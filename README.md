Project Description: 

This app is designed to help users keep track of monthly expenditures against gross budget(salary). It prompts the user via email when expenditure on a particular item/service is over 95% of its allocated budget. And also sends the user daily reminder to document all daily expenses. 

Monthly budget profile gets deleted automatically on the 30th day after creation.
