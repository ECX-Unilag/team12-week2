Project Description: 

This app is designed to help users keep track of monthly expenditures against budget(salary). It prompts the user via email when expenditure on a particular item/service is over 95% of its allocated budget. 
After a monthly budget profile is setup, the app sends daily reminder to the profile owner, reminding him to document his expenditure for the day if he has not done so already.
The app also displays history of past(months) budget profiles. Stating if it was bad, good or excellent depending on how the expenditures aligned with the budget for the particular month and the amount of money the user could save from his monthly salary. Budget history automatically resets after a year.
The app displays a chart of Total Monthly Expenditure against Month, so the user can visualize how he spends per month over a year. This resets after one year.
