Project Description: 

This app is designed to help users keep track of monthly expenditures against gross budget(salary). It prompts the user via email when expenditure on a particular item/service is over 95% of its allocated budget. And also sends the user daily reminder to document all daily expenses. Budget profile automatically gets deleted after 30 days, and the user is prompted to create another budget profile.
